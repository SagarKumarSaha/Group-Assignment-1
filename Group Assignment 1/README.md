We can say that;
To sum up, the examination of software projects using the class size information obtained from the C-K matrices tool offers insightful information on testability, reusability, and maintainability. It is clear that low Weighted Methods per Class (WMC) and Number of Children (NOC) values in the code can lead to good maintainability. This implies that a code structure that is modular, easily adjustable, and less prone to errors exists, which is advantageous for effective software maintenance.
However, the study also identifies weaknesses in the projects under review's testability and reusability. Limited code interactions with other classes are indicated by Minimal Response for a Class (RFC) values, which can make thorough testing and use in other projects difficult. The code's potential for reusability is further diminished by the low Depth of Inheritance Tree (DIT) and Number of Object Classes (NOC) numbers, which indicate a lack of hierarchical organization. It is critical to understand that code size affects maintainability significantly and may impede testability and reusability. While small codebases with low WMC and NOC values make maintenance easier, they can make testing and code reuse more difficult. The delicate balance of code size, maintainability, testability, and reusability must be struck by software engineers. The secret is to write code that is flexible, modular, and well-organized to make testing simple and allow for future reuse in a variety of applications.
